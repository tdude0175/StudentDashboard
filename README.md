# StudentDashboard
Code Schools StudentDashBoard Starter code 
## Current itteration
This version is the base foundation of the student portal. There is currently Comments inside the files to help direct the next steps towards improving the project

## Things to put into the App for use:
### Calendar for the year
  Adding A calendar will go toward helping track attendance and intergrating a section for student to check for events where they can network and grow the portal as a whole
### Lessons: Collection of lessons done with links to Repos and resources
  Currently Lessons are added to a class to then be set up for student to have classwork made for them. We can proceed by adding model Improvements to include resources for said classwork. Possibly a foreign key set to include references set in by Teachers.
### Collection of resources used during the course to teach students and other useful resources(Ex: JavaScript Question Bank)
  Creating a seperate tab that is a sorted collection of refernces will help teachers and students be able to locate information necessary for a particualar problem.
### References to classwork repository/The Works pieces and what it uses/ how to build it.
  Currently we are using a string format that students can add to their specific classwork for the work which leaves a margin for error. We could set it pu to auto populate the link for them when they click the work source url that will detect their GitHub info and auto populate it with the information.
### Report Card Page to list Students Grade.
On the students page (and the eventual Teacher Page) we need to add a section that is a sum total of all their classwork grades and how well they are doing. This has a specific layout that needs to be specified so for now using the invitation period grading sheet would be best.
### Attendance of students
  Currently there is an attendance model but is not being used. Setting up a program to help make sure students are in class on time would be extremely helpful. We can use the computer time to determine when they need to input their location that is a predetermined location they need to be which the computer geo location has to match otherwise it won't count.
##### Staff have own specific pages to work from. Teachers can build “lessons” for future use focusing on specific projects and can save templates to use for the future. 
A staff page would go a long way in Improving Teachers ability to create Lessons and Classes and reviewing their grades.
